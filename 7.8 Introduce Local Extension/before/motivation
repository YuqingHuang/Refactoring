[Motivation]

If just need few foreign method, can use "Introduce Foreign Method(162)". But if you need more than 2 extra method , you need to organize all of these method and put them to a suitable place.

To achieve this purpose, we need "Subclassing" or "Wrapping". We call the 2 together as "Local Extension".

"Create a new class that contains these extra methods. Make this extension class a subclass or a wrapper of the original."

Local extension is a independent class, also is subclass of the class which is extended: it has all the features of original class.

A principle: Method and Data should be encapsulated together.

[Practice]

1.create a extending class, as the subclass or wrapping of original class.

2.add transform constructor method to extending class.

3.add new feature to extending class.

4.replace original object by extending object.

5.move foreign method to extending class.
